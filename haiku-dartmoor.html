        Haiku from a house near Dartmoor
      </h2>
      <p class="haiku">
        The axe is still and<br>
        He pulls his arms down hard and<br>
        Logs are split spinning<br>
      </p>
      <p class="haiku">
        In here no leaves move<br>
        Flies push their way through thick air<br>
        Hot light trapped in glass<br>
      </p>
      <p class="haiku">
        An escaped bull takes<br>
        No notice of the shouting<br>
        As he runs downhill<br>
      </p>
      <p class="haiku">
        The sky is spilt milk<br>
        A sheep lies on the hillside<br>
        Is it dead is it<br>
      </p>
      <p class="haiku">
        Bracken sits steaming<br>
        Ripples stir the long drowned grass<br>
        The buzzards scream here<br>
      </p>
      <p class="haiku">
        When I was told my<br>
        Father shot and killed rabbits<br>
        I felt joy and fear<br>
      </p>
      <p class="haiku">
        Rock shaped by the wind<br>
        Rock shaped by river water<br>
        Rock shaped by a man<br>
      </p>
      <p class="haiku">
        A heron woven<br>
        Into the brocade of reeds<br>
        Trees sing sibilance<br>
      </p>
      <p class="haiku">
        Sun drips from the trees<br>
        Filling invisible pools<br>
        We walk between them<br>
      </p>
      <p class="haiku">
        Pyrite flecks of car<br>
        Glint away from and toward<br>
        The hidden valley<br>
      </p>
